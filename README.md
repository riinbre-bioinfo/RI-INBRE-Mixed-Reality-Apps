## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR) applications the RI-INBRE Molecular Informatics Core/URI ITS Student Technology Assistants Program.  The MIC and STA groups began collaborating in 2018 on developing VR apps for STEM education, particularly in the area of pharmaceutical sciences.  Some of these applications were developed as part of the Enhanced Virtual Education, RESearch, and Training (EVEREST) Pilot Awards.  Unless stated otherwise, apps were developed in Unity for HTC Vive-style VR headsets.  Mobile apps were developed exclusively for Android devices.

## Applications

Applications developed by the MIC-STA are listed below.  We try to offer the most recent functional versions of the apps, but some older developmental versions may not always work it recent Unity environments.

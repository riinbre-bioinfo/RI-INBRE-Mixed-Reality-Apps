# RI-INBRE Mixed Reality Apps
VR/AR/MR applications developed by RI-INBRE and URI ITS ILT Program
Last Updated March 23, 2023

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR) applications developed by the RI-INBRE Molecular Informatics Core/URI ITS Innovative Learning Technologies Program.  The MIC and ILT groups began collaborating in 2018 on developing VR apps for STEM education, particularly in the area of pharmaceutical sciences.  Some of these applications were developed as part of the Enhanced Virtual Education, RESearch, and Training (EVEREST) Pilot Awards.  Unless stated otherwise, apps were developed in Unity for HTC Vive-style VR headsets.  Mobile apps were developed exclusively for Android devices.

## Applications

Applications developed by the MIC-ILT are listed below.  We try to offer the most recent functional versions of the apps, but some older developmental versions may not always work it recent Unity environments.

### Aspirin VR

Sponsor: Dr. Christopher Hemme, University of Rhode Island, College of Pharmacy<br>
Funding: RI-INBRE<br>
Description: Prototype app developed in Unity to demonstrate the history, biochemistry, and pharmacology of aspirin and salicylic acid.  No executable is available and it may not work in current versions of Unity.<br>

### Methotrexate VR

Sponsor: Dr. Bongsup Cho, University of Rhode Island, College of Pharmacy<br>
Funding: RI-INBRE<br>
Description: VR app covering the mechanism of action of the anti-cancer drug methotrexate.  Executable "MTX Project.exe".  VR only.<br>

### Natural Products VR

Sponsor: Dr. Matthew Bertin, University of Rhode Island, College of Pharmacy<br>
Funding: RI-INBRE<br>
Description: VR app covering natural product chemistry of carmaphycin B, a natural product from marine cyanobacteria.  Executable "Lab - Bertin.exe".  VR and First Person versions available.<br>

### Nanoparticle and Liposome VR
